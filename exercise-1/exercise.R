# Exercise 1: Data Frame Practice

# Install devtools package: allows installations from GitHub
install.packages('devtools')

# Install "fueleconomy" package from GitHub
# Require/library the fueleconomy package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should have have access to the `vehicles` data.frame
View(vehicles)

# Create a data.frame of vehicles from 1997
vehicles.1997 <- vehicles[vehicles$year == 1997,]

# Use the `unique` function to verify that there is only 1 value in the `year` column of your new data.frame
length(unique(vehicles.1997))

# Create a data.frame of 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
special.cars <- vehicles[vehicles$drive =='2-Wheel Drive' && vehicles$cty > 20]

# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
bad.hwy <- special.cars$id[special.cars$hwy == min(special.cars$hwy)]

# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters, and returns 
# The vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
YearMakeVehicleFilter <- function(user.year, user.make) {
  filtered.cars <- vehicles[vehicles$make ==user.make && vehicles$year == user.year, ]
  return(filtered.cars[filtered.cars4hwy == max(filtered.cars$hwy),])
}


# What was the most efficient honda model of 1995?
YearMakeVehicleFilter(1995, 'Honda')

# Require/library the "fueleconomy" package
library(fueleconomy)

# You should now have access to the `vehicles` data.frame

# Use `as.data.frame()` to make it into a normal data frame


# Select the different manufacturers (makes) of the cars in this data set.


# Use the `unique()` function to determine how many different car manufacturers
# are represented by the data set.


# Filter the data set for vehicles manufactured in 1997


# Arrange the 1997 cars by highway (`hwy`) gas milage
# Hint: use the `order()` function similar to how you would use the `max()` function.
# See also: https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-sorting-a-data-frame-by-the-contents-of-a-column/


# Mutate the 1997 cars data frame to add a column `average` that has the average gas milage between
# city and highway for each car


# Filter the whole vehicles data set for 2-Wheel Drive vehicles that get more than 20 miles/gallon in the city
# Save this new data frame in a variable.


# Of those vehicles, what is the vehicle ID of the vehicle with the worst hwy mpg?
# Hint: filter for the worst vehicle, then select its ID.


# Write a function that takes a `year` and a `make` as parameters,
# and returns the vehicle that gets the most hwy miles/gallon of vehicles of that make in that year
# You'll need to filter more!
