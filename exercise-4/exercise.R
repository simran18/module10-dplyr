# Exercise 4: DPLYR and flights data

# Install the nycflights13 package and read it in.  Require the dplyr package
# install.packages("nycflights13")


# The data.frame flights should now be accessible to you.  View it,
# and get some basic information about the number of rows/columns


# Add a column that is the amount of time gained in the air


# Sort your data.frame desceding by the column you just created


# Try doing the last 2 steps in a single operation using the pipe operator


# Make a histogram of the amount of gain using the `hist` command


# On average, did flights gain or lose time?


# Create a data.frame of flights headed to seatac ('SEA'),
# and only include the column you just created


# On average, did flights to seatac gain or loose time?


# Retireve the air_time column for flights from JFK to SEA


# What was the average air time of those flights (in hours)?  What was the min/max?
